# Multi-stage Dockerfile using separate build and runtime containers.
# 
# Benefits of this setup:
# 1. **Smaller Deployment Image**: Final container includes only whatâ€™s needed to run, keeping it lightweight.
# 2. **Version Control**: Easy to specify exact versions of Erlang and Gleam.
# 3. **Faster Rebuilds**: Only the build stage is cached, making rebuilds more efficient.
